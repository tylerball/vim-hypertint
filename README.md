hypertint
=========

A vim colorscheme by Tyler Ball, inspired by many. Somewhat of a work in progress.

Installation
------------

Copy the `colors/hypertint.vim` to your `~/.vim/colors` directory, or even better,
use [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to keep it up to date.

I like parts of [molokai][molokai], [distinguised][distinguished],
[hemisu][hemisu] and [badwolf][badwolf]. If you don't like hypertint, try
those, they're great.
